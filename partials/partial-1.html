                <h2>The Value of Money</h2>

                    <p>Money is the driving force of the world. Money has an effect on everything and everything has an effect on money. Sure, the economy has a massive effect on a country; it either builds it or completely obliterates it. However, the value of money is a multifaceted topic so we would have to dissect it from various angles. In this article we are going to discuss the value of money in the literal sense as well as the figurative sense. Firstly, if we were to discuss the value of money literally we would come to understand that money exists because otherwise we would be trading food and services for labour and other peculiar things humans did before the invention of money and currency. To measure the value of money we would have to look at the exchange rates, the amount of time that has passed, and the demand. Over the years the value of money has been constantly fluctuating because of the demand for it. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, 1 dollar used to hold a lot of value. A dollar then was the equavalent of 20 dollars today which is mind-boggling to think about. Secondly, the value of money is subjective, if you ask one person their answer will probably be different than the other person. Some might view money as the sole source of contentment and bliss, whereas others would view it as the source of greed and the root of all evil in the world. At the end of the day money can either do good and bring happiness if used for good and it can also cause destruction and damage if it falls into the wrong hands.</p>

                <h3>GMO Food</h3>

                    <p>Genetically modified organisms, also commonly known as GMO foods, are foods extracted from organisms whose DNA has been altered and adjusted in an unnatural way. A gene from another organism is injected into the food which improves the food genetically and creates new characteristics that did not exist beforehand. There have been countless movements against GMO foods, questioning GMO foods and whether they have long term effects and consequences on our health. Through thorough research and experiments over the years, scientists have concluded that they are not harmful and do not pose a threat on the human body nor cause diseases. In fact they are safe for consumption. GMO foods helped us increase food production and supply which made it more efficient. The population has been witnessing a significant increase for the past decade, and GMO foods have contributed to meeting the demands of the ever-growing population. GMO foods are packed with more nutrients than regular unmodified foods. They are grown with less pesticides which are toxic and can be poisonous if not washed properly. They can also give food a longer shelf life. When foods have a longer shelf life it means there will be less consumerism and a lot of money is saved. They can also fight diseases that would usually infest foods. Although everything about GMO foods has been positive so far, they have also been critiqued. Some people see it as an unethical method since it plays with DNA and alters the original DNA structure.</p>

                <h4>The View of World in 2100</h4>

                    <img id="article" src="img/future.png">
                    <p>When you mention the year 2100, you would instantly think of flying cars and time travel. However, throughout the past decade, we have witnessed countless revolutionary technological advances. So the concept of flying cars is not that far-fetched or too good to be true. It would be interesting to see what other inventions and discoveries engineers and scientists can come up with. Year 2100 will be the year in which we will all be fully dependent on robots and A.I. for everything. Although the convenience would be out of this world, I believe this will also come with many disadvantages. If androids were to replace humans and their jobs a majority of people will lose their jobs. And there will be a high unemployment rate which will result in more people going bankrupt and on the brink of poverty. In year 2100, I think humans will be able to inhabit mars and establish a civilization there. It will be a challenging mission at first since the red planet has never been inhabited before, however, through more research, life there will become much more easier to adapt to. There will also be a plethora of medical advancements. Hopefully, a cure for cancer will be discovered with a 100% recovery rate. Which will result in a lower moratlity rate and people will be able to live longer lives.</p>
